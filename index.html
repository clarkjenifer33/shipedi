        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is a Car Transportation Quote?</h2>
            <p>Simply put, a car transportation quote is an estimate of how much it'll cost to ship your car. It's like getting a price for delivering a package, but the package is your car!</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Goes into a Car Transportation Quote?</h2>
            <p>Car shipping companies look at several things when giving you a quote:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Distance: The farther your car needs to go, the more it'll cost.</li>
                <li>Car Type: Bigger or heavier cars cost more to ship.</li>
                <li>Transport Type: Open transport or enclosed transport. Enclosed costs more but offers more protection.</li>
                <li>Time of Year: Prices can go up during busy seasons, like summer.</li>
                <li>Pick-up and Drop-off Locations: It's usually cheaper if you can meet the truck at easy-to-reach locations.</li>
                <li>Condition of the Car: If your car doesn't run, it'll cost more to ship because they need special equipment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">

                <li>Book in Advance: Last-minute bookings usually cost more.</li>
                <li>Consider Terminal-to-Terminal: It's often cheaper than door-to-door service.</li>
                <li>Ask About Discounts: Some companies offer discounts for students, military personnel, or seniors.</li>
                <li>Read Reviews: The cheapest quote isn't always the best. Check company reviews to make sure they're reliable.</li>
